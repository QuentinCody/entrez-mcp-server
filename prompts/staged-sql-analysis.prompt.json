		"Call `entrez-capabilities` with { \"tool\": \"entrez-data\", \"format\": \"detailed\" } to review staging operations and required parameters.",
		"Stage source data via `entrez-data` with `operation: \"fetch_and_stage\"`. Provide `database`, `ids`, and optionally `rettype`. Capture the returned `data_access_id`.",
		"If you need iterative queries, list datasets using `operation: \"list_datasets\"` to confirm availability and retention policy.",
		"Run SQL using `operation: \"query\"` with either a user-supplied `sql` statement or `smart_summary: true` plus `intended_use` hints when you want auto-generated insights.",
		"Inspect schema details using `operation: \"schema\"` before crafting complex queries."
	],
	"retry_guidance": [
		"Keep the staged payload modestâ€”paginate fetch operations or limit `ids` when the dataset becomes large.",
		"If SQL fails, check the schema output for exact column names and types.",
		"Use `smart_summary: true` when you are unsure which SQL to run first."
