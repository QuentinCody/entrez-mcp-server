		"Call `entrez-capabilities` with { \"tool\": \"entrez-query\", \"format\": \"detailed\" } if you need a refresher on parameter hints before starting.",
		"Use `entrez-query` with `operation: \"search\"` and a Boolean-rich `term`. Start with `retmax` <= 25 and `intended_use: \"search\"`.",
		"Summarise your primary PMIDs using `operation: \"summary\"` and `detail_level: \"brief\"` to stay token efficient.",
		"Pull abstracts for shortlisted PMIDs via `operation: \"fetch\"` with `rettype: \"abstract\"` when deeper reading is required.",
		"Persist key records through `entrez-data` `fetch_and_stage` when you anticipate SQL analysis or repeated use.",
		"Finish by synthesising findings and suggesting next investigative steps."
	],
	"retry_guidance": [
		"Prefer uppercase Boolean operators (AND/OR/NOT) inside the `term`.",
		"Restrict by publication year using `[Date]` filters before widening the scope.",
		"If responses get long, add `compact_mode: true` or set `max_tokens` to 300."
